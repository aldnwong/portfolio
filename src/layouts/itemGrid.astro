    title="SURPRISE BIRTHDAY GAME" 
    image="img/BirthdayGame.png"
    description="Over quarantine, I wanted to surprise one of my friends as their birthday was coming up. Consulting with friends, I decided it'd be a cool idea to create a fake Roblox horror game, since our friend group had been playing a lot of them over the pandemic. This game was disguised to be a generic horror game but actually included a bunch of birthday messages and images that relate to memories we had with our friend."

    title="MACRO KEYBOARD" 
    image="img/MacroKeyboard.jpg" 
    description="I've always wanted to have a Stream Deck, but I could never bring myself to pay almost $150 for one of them. Even the mini one is around $100. However, watching Taran Van Hemert, I realized I could just use an old keyboard and turn that into my own macro keyboard using Interceptor and AutoHotKey. I didn't expect this keyboard to be super useful, but now I use it everyday with my computer to open apps and run tasks with a single key."

    title="LINK SHORTENER" 
    description="Using Cloudflare's KV and Workers services, I create a link shortener that I can use to send links to friends and family without having to remember a long or complicated URL. I have a Discord bot that also allows me to view, edit, and the Key-Value pairs, so that I can easily modify any link."

    title="SENIOR BOX WEBSITE" 
    description="During my senior year of high school, my friends and I decided to make a senior box (or bocks), filled with different items that would remind us of memories over the year. As a side project, I also decided to make a website to showcase these items. For lack of time and privacy reasons, I have decided to scrap this project."

    title="SIMPLEGROUPS FABRIC MOD" 
    description="This is my first attempt at making a Fabric mod. It's a simple mod for allowing players in small servers to create their own groups, modifying their display names with colors and prefixes. It helped me learn Fabric modding, especially since I didn't have a ton of documentation to work off of."
