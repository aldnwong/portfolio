    title="SURPRISE BIRTHDAY GAME" 
    image="img/BirthdayGame.png"
    description="Over quarantine, I wanted to surprise one of my friends as their birthday was coming up. Consulting with friends, I decided it'd be a cool idea to create a fake Roblox horror game, since our friend group had been playing a lot of them over the pandemic. This game was disguised to be a generic horror game but actually included a bunch of birthday messages and images that relate to memories we had with our friend."

    title="PORTFOLIO (OLD)" 
    image="img/OldWebsite.png" 
    description="This was my first attempt at creating a website from scratch! I've always wanted to have my own website from the day I started programming, and I decided to finally try actually creating one instead of using a website builder. Using Astro, I created a very simple portfolio that switches between three pages, each with their own colors and content. I also learned how to adapt these website layouts into a mobile-friendly format. The layout of the website is not very flexible in terms of modifying it, and the code is very messy, but it helped me understand the basics of what I need to do and how I can achieve it."

    title="MACRO KEYBOARD" 
    image="img/MacroKeyboard.jpg" 
    description="I've always wanted to have a Stream Deck, but I could never bring myself to pay almost $150 for one of them. Even the mini one is around $100. However, watching Taran Van Hemert, I realized I could just use an old keyboard and turn that into my own macro keyboard using Interceptor and AutoHotKey. I didn't expect this keyboard to be super useful, but now I use it everyday with my computer to open apps and run tasks with a single key."

    title="LINK SHORTENER" 
    description="Using Cloudflare's KV and Workers services, I create a link shortener that I can use to send links to friends and family without having to remember a long or complicated URL. I have a Discord bot that also allows me to view, edit, and the Key-Value pairs, so that I can easily modify any link."

    title="SENIOR BOX WEBSITE" 
    description="During my senior year of high school, my friends and I decided to make a senior box (or bocks), filled with different items that would remind us of memories over the year. As a side project, I also decided to make a website to showcase these items. For lack of time and privacy reasons, I have decided to scrap this project. "
